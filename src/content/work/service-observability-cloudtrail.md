## The Problem

AWS accounts without CloudTrail enabled have no audit trail for API activity — no record of who changed what, when, or from where. In regulated environments, this is a compliance gap. In incident response, it means investigating blind.

## The Approach

CloudFormation-managed CloudTrail configuration establishes account-level API logging to a dedicated S3 bucket. Log file integrity validation is enabled. The deployment is automated and repeatable so it can be applied consistently across accounts.

## The Outcome

A reliable audit baseline that satisfies compliance requirements and enables post-incident forensics. Deployed as a reusable pattern that can be applied to any AWS account without manual configuration.

## Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| AWS CloudTrail | API activity logging |
| AWS S3 | Log storage with integrity validation |
| AWS CloudFormation | Infrastructure provisioning |
| AWS KMS | Log encryption at rest |
