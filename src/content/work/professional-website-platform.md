## The Problem

A professional portfolio site needs to be fast, cheap to host, easy to deploy, and fully under version control — including the infrastructure. Most hosting platforms introduce ongoing cost, vendor lock-in, or a deployment process that requires manual steps.

## The Approach

Astro-based static site with GitHub Actions CI/CD. Deployment uses OIDC authentication (no stored secrets), automated CloudFront cache invalidation, and full infrastructure as code. The entire platform — site, infrastructure, and deploy pipeline — lives in two Git repositories.

## The Outcome

Production hosting at approximately $3/month (S3 + CloudFront + Route53). Deploys automatically on push to main.

## Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Astro 5.x | Static site framework |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD pipeline |
| AWS OIDC | Keyless deploy authentication |
| AWS S3 | Static asset hosting |
| AWS CloudFront | CDN and HTTPS termination |
| AWS Route53 | DNS management |
| Terraform | Infrastructure provisioning |
