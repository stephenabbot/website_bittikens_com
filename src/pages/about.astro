				<div class="content">
					<p>
						I began my career as principal architect at Digital Equipment Corporation, designing distributed systems before transitioning to operations to understand how systems behave in production. This combination of architectural thinking and operational experience shapes my approach to building reliable, scalable solutions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, I focus on leveraging AI collaboration to accelerate solution delivery while maintaining quality. My approach is to demonstrate capability through actual solutions rather than claims. Every project in my portfolio represents problem-solving at scale.
					</p>
					<p>
						Based in Denver, Colorado, I help engineering teams build foundational practices that prevent technical debt and enable sustainable growth. Whether designing observability frameworks, automating compliance workflows, or mentoring teams on AWS best practices, I focus on solutions that work today and scale for tomorrow.
