# Professional Website Platform

## Static website demonstrating enterprise infrastructure integration

This project creates a professional website using Astro and TypeScript that serves as the capstone demonstration of how foundation infrastructure projects integrate to deliver complete, production-ready solutions. The website showcases enterprise deployment patterns through live infrastructure while providing content management capabilities for blog posts, portfolio items, and professional experience.

## What Problem This Project Solves

Professional websites require more than just content management - they need enterprise-grade infrastructure, security, and deployment workflows that demonstrate technical capabilities while maintaining modern web development practices.

- Static websites require coordination between multiple AWS services for secure, performant hosting
- Manual infrastructure configuration creates inconsistency, security gaps, and operational overhead
- Demonstrating technical capabilities requires live integration of multiple infrastructure components
- Content management needs type-safe development with automated deployment workflows
- Professional portfolios need to show working solutions rather than theoretical knowledge

## What This Project Does

Provides a complete professional website platform that integrates all foundation infrastructure projects while demonstrating enterprise deployment patterns through live implementation.

- Creates static website content using Astro framework with TypeScript schema validation
- Integrates with foundation infrastructure projects for backend state management and OIDC authentication
- Deploys content to multi-domain website infrastructure with automated SSL and global CDN
- Implements automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with secure OIDC authentication
- Demonstrates complete software development lifecycle from infrastructure foundation through application delivery
- Provides content collections for blog posts, portfolio projects, and professional experience with type safety

## What This Project Changes

Enables professional website hosting with complete enterprise infrastructure integration while establishing the capstone demonstration of foundation project capabilities.

### Resources Created/Managed

- Astro static website with TypeScript content collections and schema validation
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment with OIDC authentication
- Content management system for blog posts, work portfolio, and experience timeline
- Integration with S3 static hosting and CloudFront CDN distribution managed by website-infrastructure project
- Automated deployment scripts with comprehensive error handling and rollback support

### Functional Changes

- Enables professional website hosting with enterprise-grade deployment workflows
- Provides type-safe content management with automated validation and build processes
- Implements secure CI/CD authentication without long-lived credentials through foundation projects
- Demonstrates complete integration of foundation infrastructure components through live implementation
- Establishes patterns for content deployment separate from infrastructure management

## Quick Start

```bash
# Bootstrap project for local development
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Deploy to AWS infrastructure
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## AWS Well-Architected Framework

This project demonstrates alignment with the AWS Well-Architected Framework through integration with foundation infrastructure:

### Security
- HTTPS enforcement with automatic SSL certificate management through website-infrastructure project
- OIDC authentication eliminating long-lived credentials via foundation-iam-deploy-roles project
- S3 bucket policies and CloudFront origin access controls restricting unauthorized access
- Comprehensive security headers via CloudFront Response Headers Policy

### Reliability
- Global CDN distribution for availability and fault tolerance through CloudFront
- S3 versioning and automated backup of deployment artifacts
- Automated deployment rollback capabilities with backup and restore functionality
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms in deployment scripts

### Performance Efficiency
- CloudFront edge locations for global performance optimization
- Static site generation for optimal loading performance
- Responsive images and modern formats for efficient content delivery
- Caching strategies to minimize origin requests and improve response times

### Cost Optimization
- S3 static hosting minimizes compute costs compared to server-based solutions
- Pay-per-use pricing for CloudFront and Route53 services
- Automated lifecycle policies for efficient resource utilization
- Shared infrastructure patterns reducing per-project overhead

### Operational Excellence
- Infrastructure as Code through automated deployment scripts and GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive error handling and monitoring capabilities
- CloudFront access logs and deployment monitoring for operational visibility
- Comprehensive documentation and operational procedures
